My wife and I recently had the opportunity of travelling to South Africa to visit family and friends. We decided to take a few days off and go on a safari. We chose Tambuti Lodge in the Black Rhino Game Reserve, Pilanesberg National Park. We had a great time and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a safari experience in South Africa.

## Wildlife

We got to see so many amazing and beautiful animals. We were travelling fairly lightly so I only had my trusty Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra with me. I took a lot of photos and I thought I would share some of them here.
