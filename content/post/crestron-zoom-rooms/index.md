## Introduction

Back in 2020, while working at [AT Controls](https://www.atcontrols.com.au/) I was working on a project that required a [Crestron](https://www.crestron.com) control system to control a [Zoom Room](https://www.zoom.com/en/products/meeting-rooms/). I was tasked to create a Crestron module that can could control a Zoom Room system.

I implemented the module using Crestron SIMPL#Pro and was able to implement near feature parity with the Zoom Room controller at the time.

## Discontinued

Due to Zoom Room deprecating the ZR-CSAPI, the module development slowed and was eventually abandoned. The module was only used internally for a few clients and was never released to the public.
