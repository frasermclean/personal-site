# First Post using Hugo

I've decided to change things up on my personal website and switched to an
amazing static site generator: [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)! It's very developer
friendly and integrates beautifully with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
which I am using to host this site.

The source code for this site and a complete GitHub Actions workflow can be
viewed in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/frasermclean/personal-site).
